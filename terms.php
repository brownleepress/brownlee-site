          <h5 style="margin: 15px 0 5px;"><small>1. My Shop, My Rules:</small></h5>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 25px;">I have the final say in all things print. If I send out a job, it's been done to the best of my ability, it's good - that's the decision. No debates, no back-and-forth, just smooth sailing (for me, anyway).</p>

          <h5 style="margin: 15px 0 5px;"><small>2. No Returns, No Refunds:</small></h5>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 25px;">Once it's printed, it's yours forever. No take-backs, no do-overs. If it doesn't match your wildest dreams, remember, dreams can be weird and unpredictable.</p>

          <h5 style="margin: 15px 0 5px;"><small>3. Color & Imagination Disclaimer:</small></h5>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 25px;">If the colors, design, paper-type, or anything else doesn't exactly match what you pictured in your head — well, that's on your imagination, not on me. My job is to print, and if you're looking at your completed print job, well, my work here is done.</p>

          <h5 style="margin: 15px 0 5px;"><small>4. It's All On You:</small></h5>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 25px;">By working with me, you agree that all final decisions and quality calls are mine and mine alone. There shall be no refunds, no exceptions, and no hurt feelings. We'll all sleep better at night. zzz</p>
       
<p style="margin: 15px 0 10px; font-size: 0.85rem; line-height: 0.95rem;">Look, pobody's nerfect - and yes, that includes me! If something in your order doesn't match what was in your cart, please let me know, and I'll try my best to "make it right." I may even ping you for your two cents on what a solution could look like - after all, collaboration is fun. But let's be clear: I alone get to declare what “make it right” actually means, and maybe more importantly, if it was even "wrong" in the first place.</p>

<p style="margin: 15px 0 10px; font-size: 0.65rem; line-height: 0.8rem;">Admittedly, if you've pushed through all of this fine print and still feel like reading more, you either have too much time on your hands or you simply don't trust my impeccable judgment. Maybe you're scanning for loopholes, or perhaps you just enjoy the soothing rhythm of my legal mumbo-jumbo? Either way, congratulations on your dedication. Just know that I've poured my heart (and only a modest amount of sweat) into these terms, and I assure you they're nearly as final and unmoveable as my dog's feeding schedule. I will admin - Yes, I am human — even I will trip over a typo now and then — but you and I both understand that perfection isn't really the point; what we're all really searching for is controlled unpredictability. That's true art. Anyway, by the time you reach these final words, you've tacitly agreed that my version of “right” holds all the sway, and that there won't be any sequel to this story. If you're hoping for a reprint of a job or any form of a discount or refund, I salute your perseverance — but I'm not just handing it out. If I truly believe that I did exactly what you ordered, well, what you've got is all you're going to get. </p>

There once was a printer, Brownlee,<br>
Who said, “Check your file carefully.<br>
If the margin's a mess,<br>
Or you fumbled the specs -<br>
the cost is still billed back to thee.""
