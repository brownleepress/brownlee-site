          <h4>Who is Brownlee?</h4>
          <p style="margin: 20px 0;">
            Brownlee was the last name of my maternal Grandmother, Barbara. Grandma Barb was an artist who made her mark in hand-lettered sign painting. I remember being a kid, watching her paint big 'happy birthday' banners, and grocery store 'sale' signs. This was in the 80s, things were different! She didn't have Photoshop, or a computer, or a printer. She had a shoestring budget, a steady hand, and an eye for detail - and that was exactly what you needed to be successful in the business at the time.

            My grandma knew I was artsy - she kept me stocked with drawing supplies, challenged me and taught me about style, design, and layout, and always encouraged me to do whatever made me happy. Well Grandma, this is it - I'm doing it. </p>

<i>That's me!</i> I'm almost always printing, and I'm getting pretty good at it! When I'm not at the shop, I spend my time listening to music (Frightened Rabbit, Bon Iver, Cake) and making music (Stepladders, Public Access), watching TV (I Think You Should Leave, 30 Rock, Scrubs, Curb Your Enthusiasm), and talking to strangers.
<br><br>
I'm getting married to my sweetheart (Jillian) ASAP. We've done a couple of rounds of COVID postponements, and it's depressing. But, we'll be married soon. (September 2025)
<br><br>
I like fixing stuff around the house, trying to keep plants alive, trivia nights, and eating good hamburgers (Choo Choo Grill). Also, I can't mention my favorite things without giving a nod to the kings of the soda world - FAYGO!
